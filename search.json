The darker colors in the heatmap indicate stronger correlations (either positive or negative).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe correlation plot shows that there are no strong correlations between the variables.

    "text": "Limitations and Future Work\n\nThe dataset is designed for machine learning and therefore has a uniform distribution of the categorical variables to help with classification tasks. However, this makes it difficult to make any definitive conclusions about the relationship between the variables with simple statistical models.\nFurther multivariate analyses could help identify interactions between multiple risk factors.\nPredictive modeling should be applied to determine which factors best predict heart disease status as simple statistical models are not sufficient to make any definitive conclusions.\nAdditional lifestyle and genetic factors not included in this dataset may play important roles in heart disease risk."
